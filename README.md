Spawn a waifu as your bodyguard required a game character model, this script didn't provides any game character model data, but it contains a model name list from ``Waifus Mega Pack`` mod by default. If the ``Waifus Mega Pack`` haven't installed in your GTAV game yet, and the ``waifus.txt`` is not presented in the ``script`` folder, then this script will not spawn any bodyguards. If you want to spawn a custom set of model, write your model name into the ``waifus.txt`` file.
